# ShadowScript v0.0.1

ShadowScript is a new coding language that uses TypeScript with Deno. It provides a powerful and flexible environment for developers to create and run their code.

## Getting Started

To get started with ShadowScript, you'll need to have Deno installed on your system. You can find instructions on how to install Deno [here](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation).

Once you have Deno installed, you can run ShadowScript code by putting the code into the text.shadow then running the following command:

```bash
deno run -A lexer.ts
```
